        Arbitration graph with verification at $t=\SI{1.9}{\second}$.
        The safety verifier detects that the fail-safe trajectory of \behavior{ChangeLaneLeft}
        overlaps with the worst-case occupancies of the green vehicle
        (\cref{fig:experiments-safe-occupancies}).
        As a result, the \arbitrator{UrbanDriving} arbitrator choses the next best option \behavior{FollowLane}.
