% Another LATEX 2Îµ limitation (patched with stfloats or not) is

      Timeline of the chosen behavior in the case with verification.
      The verifier prevents unsafe behavior commands from being executed.
      The arbitrator falls back to another safe behavior option,
      \behavior{FollowLane} in this case.
