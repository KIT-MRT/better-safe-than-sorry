The autonomous vehicle was equipped with close-to-production sensor hardware and relied solely on vision and radar sensors in combination with accurate digital maps to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex traffic situations. The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving. The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg). The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic.

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by: (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes; (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar to that in the image. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits, and the COIL data set},

Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents;researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them.

  abstract = {A systematic review is provided on artificial agent methodologies applicable to control engineering of autonomous vehicles and robots. The paper focuses on some fundamentals that make a machine autonomous: decision making that involves modelling the environment and forming data abstractions for symbolic processing and logic-based reasoning. Most relevant capabilities such as navigation, autonomous path planning, path following control, and communications, that directly affect decision making, are treated as basic skills of agents. Although many autonomous vehicles have been engineered in the past without using the agent-oriented approach, most decision making onboard of vehicles is similar to or can be classified as some kind of agent architecture, even if in a naïve form. First the ANSI standard of intelligent systems is recalled then a summary of the fundamental types of possible agent architectures for autonomous vehicles are presented, starting from reactive, through layered, to advanced architectures in terms of beliefs, goals, and intentions. The review identifies some missing links between computer science results on discrete agents and engineering results of continuous world sensing, actuation, and path planning. In this context design tools for ‘abstractions programming’ are identified as needed to fill in the gap between logic-based reasoning and sensing. Finally, research is reviewed on autonomous vehicles in water, on the ground, in the air, and in space with comments on their methods of decision making. One of the main conclusions of this review is that standardization of decision making through agent architectures is desirable for the future of intelligent vehicle developments and their legal certification.},

Search is only likely to succeed in resource-bounded agents if they have already been biased towards finding the right answer. In artificial agents, the primary source of bias is engineering. This dissertation describes an approach, Behavior-Oriented Design (BOD) for engineering complex agents. A complex agent is one that must arbitrate between potentially conflicting goals or behaviors. Behavior-oriented design builds on work in behavior-based and hybrid architectures for agents, and the object oriented approach to software engineering. The primary contributions of this dissertation are: 1. The BOD architecture: a modular architecture with each module providing specialized representations to facilitate learning. This includes one pre-specified module and representation for action selection or behavior arbitration. The specialized representation underlying BOD action selection is Parallel-rooted, Ordered, Slip-stack Hierarchical (POSH) reactive plans. 2. The BOD development process: an iterative process that alternately scales the agent's capabilities then optimizes the agent for simplicity, exploiting tradeoffs between the component representations. This ongoing process for controlling complexity not only provides bias for the behaving agent, but also facilitates its maintenance and extendibility.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a decision-making framework for automated driving in highway environments. The framework is capable of reliably, robustly assessing a given highway situation (with respect to the possibility of collision) and of automatically determining an appropriate maneuver for the situation. It consists of two main components: situation assessment and strategy decision. The situation assessment component utilizes multiple complementary “threat measures” and Bayesian networks in its calculations of “threat levels” at the car and lane level to evaluate the possibility of collisions for a given highway traffic situation. The strategy decision component, designed to generate goal-directed and collision-free behaviors, automatically determines an appropriate maneuver in a given highway situation via a hierarchical state machine-such a machine both reduces the complexity of and extends a strategy model. The types of maneuver determined by the component include both simple maneuvers, such as slowing down to avoid collision with a vehicle in front, and complex maneuvers, such as lane changes and overtaking. The presented decision-making framework is tested and evaluated-both on a closed high-speed test track in simulated traffic with various driving scenarios and on public highways in real traffic through in-vehicle testing-to verify that it can provide sufficiently reliable performance for automated driving in highway environments in terms of safety, reliability, and robustness.},

  abstract = {The requirement of flexibility in the modern industries demands robots that can be efficiently and quickly adapted to different tasks. A way to achieve such a flexible programming paradigm is to instruct robots with task goals and leave planning algorithms to deduct the correct sequence of actions to use in the specific context. A common approach is to connect the skills that realize a semantically defined operation in the planning domain - such as picking or placing an object - to specific executable functions. As a result the skills are treated as independent components, which results into suboptimal execution. In this paper we present an approach where the execution procedures and the planning domain are specified at the same time using solely extended Behavior Trees (eBT), a model formalized and discussed in this paper. At run-time, the robot can use the more abstract skills to plan a sequence using a PDDL planner, expand the sequence into a hierarchical tree, and re-organize it to optimize the time of execution and the use of resources. The optimization is demonstrated on a kitting operation in both simulation and lab environment, showing up to 20\% save in the final execution time.},

In this paper, we analyze how the BT representation increases the modularity of an HDS and how key system properties are preserved over compositions of such systems, in terms of combining two BTs into a larger one. We also show how BTs can be seen as a generalization of sequential behavior compositions, the subsumption architecture, and decisions trees. These three tools are powerful but quite different, and the fact that they are unified in a natural way in BTs might be a reason for their popularity in the gaming community. We conclude the paper by giving a set of examples illustrating how the proposed analysis tools can be applied to robot control BTs.},

  abstract = {Behavior Trees (BTs) were invented as a tool to enable modular AI in computer games, but have received an increasing amount of attention in the robotics community in the last decade. With rising demands on agent AI complexity, game programmers found that the Finite State Machines (FSM) that they used scaled poorly and were difficult to extend, adapt and reuse. In BTs, the state transition logic is not dispersed across the individual states, but organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with the states as leaves. This has a significant effect on modularity, which in turn simplifies both synthesis and analysis by humans and algorithms alike. These advantages are needed not only in game AI design, but also in robotics, as is evident from the research being done. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of the topic of BTs in Artificial Intelligence and Robotic applications. The existing literature is described and categorized based on methods, application areas and contributions, and the paper is concluded with a list of open research challenges.},

All those areas are characterized by requirements such as high quality of service, reliability, robustness in harsh environment and short update time for environmental perception, and even imaging tasks. In the vehicle safety and driver assistance field, radars have found widespread application globally in nearly all vehicle brands. With the market introduction of the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class vehicle equipped with six radar sensors covering the vehicles environment 360° in the near (up to 40 m) and far range (up to 200 m), autonomous driving has become a reality even in low-speed highway scenarios. A large azimuth field of view, multimodality and a high update rate have been the key innovations on the radar side. One major step toward autonomous driving was made in August 2013. A Mercedes-Benz research S-Class vehicle-referred to at Mercedes as Bertha-drove completely autonomously for about 100 km from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany. It followed the well-known historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route. This was done on the basis of one stereo vision system, comprising several long and short range radar sensors. These radars have been modified in Doppler resolution and dramatically improved in their perception capabilities. The new algorithms consider that urban scenarios are characterized by significantly shorter reaction and observation times, shorter mean free distances, a 360° interaction zone, and a large variety of object types to be considered. This paper describes the main challenges that Daimler radar researchers faced and their solutions to make Bertha see.},

While simple predictions, e.g. based on assuming constant velocity, may suffice for deciding a driving strategy, predicting the set of all possible behaviors is required to ensure safe motion plans. In this work, we propose a novel tool for the latter problem based on reachability analysis: Set-Based Prediction Of Traffic Participants (SPOT). Our tool can predict the future occupancy of other traffic participants, including all possible maneuvers (e.g. full acceleration, full braking, and arbitrary lane changes), by considering physical constraints and assuming that the traffic participants abide by the traffic rules. However, we remove assumptions for each traffic participant individually as soon as a violation of a traffic rule is detected. Removal of assumptions automatically results in larger occupancies and thus a smaller drivable area for the ego vehicle, ensuring that the ego vehicle does not cause a collision during the time horizon of the prediction. Experimental results show that we obtain the set of future occupancies within a fraction of the prediction horizon. Our tool is available at spot.in.tum.de.},

Beyond functional safety, industry must guarantee the operational safety of automated vehicles.

In this paper we expand upon this work introducing the C++ Library for Responsibility Sensitive Safety, an open source executable that implements a subset of RSS. We provide architectural details to integrate the C++ Library for Responsibility Sensitive Safety with AD Software pipelines as safety module overseeing decision making of driving policies. We illustrate this application with an example integration with the Baidu Apollo AD stack and simulator, [2] and [3], that provides safety validation of the planning module. Furthermore, we show how the C++ Library for Responsibility Sensitive Safety can be used to explore the usefulness of the RSS model through parameter exploration and analysis on minimum safe longitudinal distance, (dmin), considering different weather conditions. We also compare these results with half-of-speed rule followed in some parts of the world. We expect that the C++ Library for Responsibility Sensitive Safety becomes a critical component of future tools for formal verification, testing and validation of AD safety and that it helps bootstrap the AD research efforts towards standardization of safety.},

Previous works ignore this uncertainty or often address it by computing probability distributions of other traffic participants over time. Probabilistic approaches make it possible to predict the collision probability with other traffic participants, but cannot formally guarantee (i.e., cannot mathematically prove for given assumptions) whether a planned maneuver is collision-free. Our approach addresses exactly this problem: instead of computing probability distributions, we compute an over-approximation of all possible occupancies of surrounding traffic participants over time. This makes it possible to prove whether an automated vehicle can possibly collide with other traffic participants. The presented algorithm for occupancy prediction works on arbitrary road networks and produces results within a fraction of the prediction horizon. Experiments based on real-world data validate our approach and show that we could not find a behavior of a traffic participant that is not enclosed in our prediction.},

The second parameter is scalability --- engineering solutions that lead to unleashed costs will not scale to millions of cars, which will push interest in this field into a niche academic corner, and drive the entire field into a "winter of autonomous driving".

  abstract = {Developing advanced robotics applications is now facing the safety issue for users, the environment, and the robot itself, which is a main limitation for their deployment in real life. This safety could be justified by the use of dependability techniques as it is done in other safety-critical applications. However, due to specific robotic properties (such as continuous human–robot physical interaction or non deterministic decisional layer), many techniques need to be adapted or revised. This paper reviews the main issues, research work and challenges in the field of safety-critical robots, linking up dependability and robotics concepts.},

Deliberation is meant to endow a robotic system with extended, more adaptable and robust functionalities, as well as reduce its deployment cost. The ambition of this survey is to present a global overview of deliberation functions in robotics and to discuss the state of the art in this area. The following five deliberation functions are identified and analyzed: planning, acting, monitoring, observing, and learning. The paper introduces a global perspective on these deliberation functions and discusses their main characteristics, design choices and constraints. The reviewed contributions are discussed with respect to this perspective. The survey focuses as much as possible on papers with a clear robotics content and with a concern on integrating several deliberation functions.},

  abstract = {Modern robots are increasingly capable of performing “basic” activities such as localization, navigation, and motion planning. However, for a robot to be considered intelligent, we would like it to be able to automatically combine these capabilities in order to achieve a high-level goal. The field of automated planning (sometimes called AI planning) deals with automatically synthesizing plans that combine basic actions to achieve a high-level goal. In this article, we focus on the intersection of automated planning and robotics and discuss some of the challenges and tools available to employ automated planning in controlling robots. We review different types of planning formalisms and discuss their advantages and limitations, especially in the context of planning robot actions. We conclude with a brief guide aimed at helping roboticists choose the right planning model to endow a robot with planning capabilities.},

  abstract = {Robots with many degrees of freedom (e.g., humanoid robots and mobile manipulators) have increasingly been employed to accomplish realistic tasks in domains such as disaster relief, spacecraft logistics, and home caretaking. Finding feasible motions for these robots autonomously is essential for their operation. Sampling-based motion planning algorithms are effective for these high-dimensional systems; however, incorporating task constraints (e.g., keeping a cup level or writing on a board) into the planning process introduces significant challenges. This survey describes the families of methods for sampling-based planning with constraints and places them on a spectrum delineated by their complexity. Constrained sampling-based methods are based on two core primitive operations: (a) sampling constraint-satisfying configurations and (b) generating constraint-satisfying continuous motion. Although this article presents the basics of sampling-based planning for contextual background, it focuses on the representation of constraints and sampling-based planners that incorporate constraints.},

  abstract = {Die Verkehrssicherheit, im ingenieurswissenschaftlichen Fokus, lässt sich aus vielen verschiedenen Blickwinkeln betrachten. Je nach Zugehörigkeit einer Domäne (z.B. Schienenverkehr, Straßenverkehr bzw. Luftverkehr oder Schifffahrt), dem Systemblickwinkel oder unterschiedlichen Detaillierungstiefen ergeben sich verschiedene Interpretationen und Ansätze die Sicherheit zu beeinflussen.  Mit dem Ziel die Verkehrssicherheit zu verbessern, werden zum Teil komplexe technische Lösungen aufwendig entwickelt, ohne eine direkte oder indirekte sicherheitsfördernde Auswirkung zu prognostizieren. Auf Basis lokaler akuter Probleme werden häufig lokale Lösungen erstellt, deren erhoffte Wirkung jedoch teilweise ausbleibt. Mögliche Ursachen für die Entwicklung vorwiegend schneller lokaler Lösungen sind zum einen der akute Handlungsbedarf, der sich zum Teil durch die hohe Erwartungshaltung der Gesellschaft bei Unglücksfällen begründet, und zum anderen auch die hohe Komplexität des jeweils betroffenen Verkehrssystems selber, sowie die eher abstrakte und nicht unmittelbar messbare Größe der Verkehrssicherheit und dem damit verbundenen Problem, diese nicht direkt beeinflussen zu können. Die vorliegende Arbeit konzentriert sich auf eine systemische, auf systemtheoretischen Grundlagen aufbauende Analyse der Systemsicherheit. Ein wesentlicher Bestandteil dieser Analyse ist die Verwendung von Begriffsmodellen zur Identifikation einer konsistenten Begriffswelt und somit zur Vermittlung eines umfassenden Systemwissens, um darauf aufbauend Theorien der Systemsicherheit in Verbindung mit generischen Sicherheitsimplementierungskonzepten formalisieren zu können. Anhand dieser systemübergreifenden jedoch konsistenten Betrachtungen gelingt die Portierung der Erkenntnisse auf das System Verkehr und die Formalisierung der Verkehrssicherheit mit einfachen verkehrssystemunabhängigen Modellen.},

The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide.},

  abstract = {The development of “intelligent” systems that can take decisions and perform autonomously might lead to faster and more consistent decisions. A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent” machines. For sensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting human well-being or health, it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper, non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system, we see a strong need to validate its behavior, and thus establish guarantees that it will continue to perform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. In pursuit of that objective, ways for humans to verify the agreement between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI, focused on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of algorithms, theory, and applications of interpretable and explainable AI and AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse in this field and providing directions of future development. The book is organized in six parts: towards AI transparency; methods for interpreting AI systems; explaining the decisions of AI systems; evaluating interpretability and explanations; applications of explainable AI; and software for explainable AI.},

Increasingly, such analyses are being applied to a wider class of systems in which problems such as lack of data, complexity of the systems, uncertainty about consequences, make a classical statistical analysis difficult or impossible. The authors discuss the fundamental notion of uncertainty, its relationship with probability, and the limits to the quantification of uncertainty. Drawing on extensive experience in the theory and applications of risk analysis, the authors focus on the conceptual and mathematical foundations underlying the quantification, interpretation and management of risk. They cover standard topics as well as important new subjects such as the use of expert judgement and uncertainty propagation. The relationship of risk analysis with decision making is highlighted in chapters on influence diagrams and decision theory. Finally, the difficulties of choosing metrics to quantify risk, and current regulatory frameworks are discussed.},

  abstract = {It was in the middle of the 1980s, when the seminal paper by Kar­ markar opened a new epoch in nonlinear optimization. The importance of this paper, containing a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear op­ timization problems, was not only in its complexity bound. At that time, the most surprising feature of this algorithm was that the theoretical pre­ diction of its high efficiency was supported by excellent computational results. This unusual fact dramatically changed the style and direc­ tions of the research in nonlinear optimization. Thereafter it became more and more common that the new methods were provided with a complexity analysis, which was considered a better justification of their efficiency than computational experiments. In a new rapidly develop­ ing field, which got the name "polynomial-time interior-point methods", such a justification was obligatory. Afteralmost fifteen years of intensive research, the main results of this development started to appear in monographs [12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Approximately at that time the author was asked to prepare a new course on nonlinear optimization for graduate students. The idea was to create a course which would reflect the new developments in the field. Actually, this was a major challenge. At the time only the theory of interior-point methods for linear optimization was polished enough to be explained to students. The general theory of self-concordant functions had appeared in print only once in the form of research monograph [12].},

  abstract = {Robot software systems tend to be complex. This complexity is due, in large part, to the need to control diverse sensors and actuators in real time, in the face of significant uncertainty and noise. Robot systems must work to achieve tasks while monitoring for, and reacting to, unexpected situations. Doing all this concurrently and asynchronously adds immensely to system complexity.The use of a well-conceived architecture, together with programming tools that support the architecture, can often help to manage that complexity. Currently, there is no single architecture that is best for all applications – different architectures have different advantages and disadvantages. It is important to understand those strengths and weaknesses when choosing an architectural approach for a given application.This chapter presents various approaches to architecting robotic systems. It starts by defining terms and setting the context, including a recounting of the historical developments in the area of robot architectures. The chapter then discusses in more depth the major types of architectural components in use today – behavioral control (Chap. 13), executives, and task planners (Chap. 14) – along with commonly used techniques for interconnecting connecting those components. Throughout, emphasis will be placed on programming tools and environments that support these architectures. A case study is then presented, followed by a brief discussion of further reading.},

  abstract = {This book introduces the concept of software architecture as one of the cornerstones of software in modern cars. Following a historical overview of the evolution of software in modern cars and a discussion of the main challenges driving that evolution, Chapter 2 describes the main architectural styles of automotive software and their use in cars’ software. Chapter 3 details this further by presenting two modern architectural styles, i.e. centralized and federated software architectures. In Chapter 4, readers will find a description of the software development processes used to develop software on the car manufacturers’ side. Chapter 5 then introduces AUTOSAR – an important standard in automotive software. Chapter 6 goes beyond simple architecture and describes the detailed design process for automotive software using Simulink, helping readers to understand how detailed design links to high-level design. The new chapter 7 reports on how machine learning is exploited in automotive software e.g. for image recognition and how both on-board and off-board learning are applied. Next, Chapter 8 presents a method for assessing the quality of the architecture – ATAM (Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method) – and provides a sample assessment, while Chapter 9 presents an alternative way of assessing the architecture, namely by using quantitative measures and indicators. Subsequently Chapter 10 dives deeper into one of the specific properties discussed in Chapter 8 – safety – and details an important standard in that area, the ISO/IEC 26262 norm. Lastly, Chapter 11 presents a set of future trends that are currently emerging and have the potential to shape automotive software engineering in the coming years. This book explores the concept of software architecture for modern cars and is intended for both beginning and advanced software designers. It mainly aims at two different groups of audience – professionals working with automotive software who need to understand concepts related to automotive architectures, and students of software engineering or related fields who need to understand the specifics of automotive software to be able to construct cars or their components. Accordingly, the book also contains a wealth of real-world examples illustrating the concepts discussed and requires no prior background in the automotive domain. Compared to the first edition, besides the two new chapters 3 and 7 there are considerable updates in chapters 5 and 8 especially.},

From randomly initialised parameters, our model is able to learn a policy for lane following in a handful of training episodes using a single monocular image as input. We provide a general and easy to obtain reward: the distance travelled by the vehicle without the safety driver taking control. We use a continuous, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm, with all exploration and optimisation performed on-vehicle. This demonstrates a new framework for autonomous driving which moves away from reliance on defined logical rules, mapping, and direct supervision. We discuss the challenges and opportunities to scale this approach to a broader range of autonomous driving tasks.},

  abstract = {High-definition maps (HD maps) are a key component of most modern self-driving systems due to their valuable semantic and geometric information. Unfortunately, building HD maps has proven hard to scale due to their cost as well as the requirements they impose in the localization system that has to work everywhere with centimeter-level accuracy. Being able to drive without an HD map would be very beneficial to scale self-driving solutions as well as to increase the failure tolerance of existing ones (e.g., if localization fails or the map is not up-to-date). Towards this goal, we propose MP3, an end-to-end approach to mapless1 driving where the input is raw sensor data and a high-level command (e.g., turn left at the intersection). MP3 predicts intermediate representations in the form of an online map and the current and future state of dynamic agents, and exploits them in a novel neural motion planner to make interpretable decisions taking into account uncertainty. We show that our approach is significantly safer, more comfortable, and can follow commands better than the baselines in challenging long-term closed-loop simulations, as well as when compared to an expert driver in a large-scale real-world dataset.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

Recent advances in the field of perception, planning, and decision-making for autonomous vehicles have led to great improvements in functional capabilities, with several prototypes already driving on our roads and streets. Yet challenges remain regarding guaranteed performance and safety under all driving circumstances. For instance, planning methods that provide safe and system-compliant performance in complex, cluttered environments while modeling the uncertain interaction with other traffic participants are required. Furthermore, new paradigms, such as interactive planning and end-to-end learning, open up questions regarding safety and reliability that need to be addressed. In this survey, we emphasize recent approaches for integrated perception and planning and for behavior-aware planning, many of which rely on machine learning. This raises the question of verification and safety, which we also touch upon. Finally, we discuss the state of the art and remaining challenges for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles.},

These scenarios have been chosen such that the performance of the implementation of cooperative adaptive cruise control of each participant can be judged. Evaluation of the vehicle behavior has been performed by means of video-based roadside units, installed at the test site in The Netherlands, that is capable of tracking the individual vehicles, in addition to the information obtained through wireless communication. Judgment criteria include both macroscale criteria, such as platoon length and traffic light throughput, and individual criterion, like string stability. Most teams performed well, although clear differences in performance and reliability could be observed. The GCDC showed that it is possible to cooperatively drive with heterogeneous systems. It is envisioned to make the GCDC a regular event and to further extend the active role of roadside communication units, as well as include automated lateral vehicle control.},

  abstract = {Automated driving requires decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments. The uncertainty from the prediction originates from the noisy sensor data and from the fact that the intention of human drivers cannot be directly measured. This problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the intended route of the other vehicles as hidden variables. The solution of the POMDP is a policy determining the optimal acceleration of the ego vehicle along a preplanned path. Therefore, the policy is optimized for the most likely future scenarios resulting from an interactive, probabilistic motion model for the other vehicles. Considering possible future measurements of the surrounding cars allows the autonomous car to incorporate the estimated change in future prediction accuracy in the optimal policy. A compact representation results in a low-dimensional state-space. Thus, the problem can be solved online for varying road layouts and number of vehicles. This is done with a point-based solver in an anytime fashion on a continuous state-space. Our evaluation is threefold: At first, the convergence of the algorithm is evaluated and it is shown how the convergence can be improved with an additional search heuristic. Second, we show various planning scenarios to demonstrate how the introduction of different considered uncertainties results in more conservative planning. At the end, we show online simulations for the crossing of complex (unsignalized) intersections. We can demonstrate that our approach performs nearly as good as with full prior information about the intentions of the other vehicles and clearly outperforms reactive approaches.},

Worst-case predictions result in over-conservative behavior while the RSS approach makes strong assumptions w.r.t. lateral and longitudinal behavior. Our contribution is a first step in bringing both worlds together, to benefit from respective advantages. First, we define RSS-motivated safe-states for merge and crossing scenarios, that ensure absolute safety towards leading vehicles, appropriate time gaps towards following vehicles in merging lanes and minimum clearance time of conflict zones with crossing lanes. We then show how to integrate these safety constraints in a trajectory and behavior planner using reachable sets and finally illustrate its usefulness in various simulative evaluations.},

  abstract = {Behavior planning and decision-making are some of the biggest challenges for highly automated systems. A fully automated vehicle (AV) is faced with numerous tactical and strategical choices. Most state-of-the-art AV platforms are implementing tactical and strategical behavior generation using finite state machines. However, these usually result in poor explainability, maintainability and scalability. Research in robotics has raised many architectures to mitigate these problems, most interestingly behavior-based systems and hybrid derivatives. Inspired by these approaches, we propose a hierarchical behavior-based architecture for tactical and strategical behavior generation in automated driving. It is a generalizing and scalable decision-making framework, utilizing modular behavior blocks to compose more complex behaviors in a bottom-up approach. The system is capable of combining a variety of scenario- and methodology-specific solutions, like POMDPs, RRT* or learning-based behavior, into one understandable and traceable architecture. We extend the hierarchical behavior-based arbitration concept to address scenarios where multiple behavior options are applicable, but have no clear priority among each other. Then, we formulate the behavior generation stack for automated driving in urban and highway environments, incorporating parking and emergency behaviors as well. Finally, we illustrate our design in an explanatory evaluation.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning applications are spreading among different domains, including autonomous vehicle control. The diverse situations that can happen during, for instance, at a highway commute are infinite, and with labeled data, the perfect coverage of all use-cases sounds ambitious. However, with the complex tasks and complicated scenarios faced during an autonomous vehicle system design, the credit assignment problem arises. How to construct appropriate objectives for the artificial intelligence to learn and the preferences between the different goals also matter of the designer's choice. This work attempts to tackle the problem by utilizing successor features and providing a possible decomposition of the reward functions, guiding the agent's actions. This method makes the training easier for the agent and enables immediate, profound performance on new combined tasks. Furthermore, with the optimal composition, the desired behavior can be fine-tuned, and as an auxiliary gain, the decomposition empowers different driving styles and makes driving preferences rapidly changeable. We introduce the adaptation of FastRL algorithm to autonomous vehicle domain, meanwhile developing a stabilizing way of using Successor Features, namely DoubleFastRL. We compare our solution for a highway driving scenario with basic agents such as Q-learning having multi-objective training.},

  abstract = {While self-driving cars have already been widely investigated and achieved spectacular progress, a major obstacle in applications is the great difficulty in providing formal guarantees about their behaviors. Since the environment of the self-driving is usually not known beforehand and highly uncertain, classical verification approaches cannot be applied to guarantee safety. To cope with any traffic situation, a novel online verification framework is presented for verifying behavioral safety of self-driving cars. The framework is based on the proposed five safety considerations: new longitudinal and lateral safe distances, lane changes, overtaking and how to face new traffic participants. Different from the previous verification considerations, this verification framework allows actual behaviors of self-driving cars to be temporarily inconsistent with the popular strict safe distance. As long as the self-driving car respects the minimum safe distance calculated by our technique and executes improvement behaviors to restore the safe distance, it is still believed that the predictive behavior is safe. The framework can easily be integrated to existing self-driving systems and evaluate different indicators involving the steering angle, acceleration and braking. The benefits of the framework in different urban scenarios of the CARLA simulator and real traffic data provided by the NGSIM project are demonstrated. Results show that the technology can successfully detect unsafe behaviors and provide effective measures to avoid potential collisions.},

This paper describes a new way to conveniently define the desired behavior for autonomous agents, which we use on the self-driving cars developed at nuTonomy, an Aptiv company. We define a “rulebook” as a pre-ordered set of “rules”, each akin to a violation metric on the possible outcomes (“realizations”). The rules are partially ordered by priority. The semantics of a rulebook imposes a pre-order on the set of realizations. We study the compositional properties of the rulebooks, and we derive which operations we can allow on the rulebooks to preserve previously-introduced constraints. While we demonstrate the application of these techniques in the self-driving domain, the methods are domain-independent.},

  abstract = {In many real-world decision making problems, reaching an optimal decision requires taking into account a variable number of objects around the agent. Autonomous driving is a domain in which this is especially relevant, since the number of cars surrounding the agent varies considerably over time and affects the optimal action to be taken. Classical methods that process object lists can deal with this requirement. However, to take advantage of recent high-performing methods based on deep reinforcement learning in modular pipelines, special architectures are necessary. For these, a number of options exist, but a thorough comparison of the different possibilities is missing. In this paper, we elaborate limitations of fully-connected neural networks and other established approaches like convolutional and recurrent neural networks in the context of reinforcement learning problems that have to deal with variable sized inputs. We employ the structure of Deep Sets in off-policy reinforcement learning for high-level decision making, highlight their capabilities to alleviate these limitations, and show that Deep Sets not only yield the best overall performance but also offer better generalization to unseen situations than the other approaches.},

  abstract = {The large-scale deployment of automated vehicles on public roads has the potential to vastly change the transportation modalities of today's society. Although this pursuit has been initiated decades ago, there still exist open challenges in reliably ensuring that such vehicles operate safely in open contexts. While functional safety is a well-established concept, the question of measuring the behavioral safety of a vehicle remains subject to research. One way to both objectively and computationally analyze traffic conflicts is the development and utilization of so-called criticality metrics. Contemporary approaches have leveraged the potential of criticality metrics in various applications related to automated driving, e.g. for computationally assessing the dynamic risk or filtering large data sets to build scenario catalogs. As a prerequisite to systematically choose adequate criticality metrics for such applications, we extensively review the state of the art of criticality metrics, their properties, and their applications in the context of automated driving. Based on this review, we propose a suitability analysis as a methodical tool to be used by practitioners. Both the proposed method and the state of the art review can then be harnessed to select well-suited measurement tools that cover an application's requirements, as demonstrated by an exemplary execution of the analysis. Ultimately, efficient, valid, and reliable measurements of an automated vehicle's safety performance are a key requirement for demonstrating its trustworthiness.},

  abstract = {Nature is filled with examples of autonomous creatures capable of dealing with the diversity, unpredictability, and rapidly changing conditions of the real world. Such creatures must make decisions and take actions based on incomplete perception, time constraints, limited knowledge about the world, cognition, reasoning and physical capabilities, in uncontrolled conditions and with very limited cues about the intent of others. Consequently, one way of evaluating intelligence is based on the creature’s ability to make the most of what it has available to handle the complexities of the real world. The main objective of this chapter is to explain behavior-based systems and their use in autonomous control problems and applications. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 13.1 overviews robot control, introducing behavior-based systems in relation to other established approaches to robot control. Section 13.2 follows by outlining the basic principles of behavior-based systems that make them distinct from other types of robot control architectures. The concept of basis behaviors, the means of modularizing behavior-based systems, is presented in Sect. 13.3. Section 13.4 describes how behaviors are used as building blocks for creating representations for use by behavior-based systems, enabling the robot to reason about the world and about itself in that world. Section 13.5 presents several different classes of learning methods for behavior-based systems, validated on single-robot and multi-robot systems. Section 13.6 provides an overview of various robotics problems and application domains that have successfully been addressed or are currently being studied with behavior-based control. Finally, Sect. 13.7 concludes the chapter.},

The behavior of numerous traffic participants in a scene cannot be predicted reliably due to complex interdependencies and the indiscriminate behavior of humans. Additionally, we face high uncertainties and only incomplete environment knowledge. Recent approaches minimize risk with probabilistic and machine learning methods - even under occlusions. These generate comfortable behavior with good traffic flow, but cannot guarantee safety of their maneuvers. Therefore, we contribute a safety verification method for trajectories under occlusions. The field-of-view of the ego vehicle and a map are used to identify critical sensing field edges, each representing a potentially hidden obstacle. The state of occluded obstacles is unknown, but can be over-approximated by intervals over all possible states. Then set-based methods are extended to provide occupancy predictions for obstacles with state intervals. The proposed method can verify the safety of given trajectories (e.g. if they ensure collision-free fail-safe maneuver options) w.r.t. arbitrary safe-state formulations. The potential for provably safe trajectory planning is shown in three evaluative scenarios.},

  abstract = {By considering a lane change maneuver as primarily a longitudinal motion planning problem, this paper presents a lane change maneuver algorithm with a pragmatic approach to determine an inter-vehicle traffic gap and time instance to perform the maneuver. The proposed approach selects an appropriate inter-vehicle traffic gap and time instance to perform the lane change maneuver by simply estimating whether there might exist a longitudinal trajectory that allows the automated vehicle to safely perform the maneuver. The lane change maneuver algorithm then proceeds to solve two loosely coupled convex quadratic programs to obtain the longitudinal trajectory to position the automated vehicle in the selected inter-vehicle traffic gap at the desired time instance and the corresponding lateral trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to select an appropriate inter-vehicle traffic gap and time instance to initialize the lateral motion of a lane change maneuver in various traffic scenarios. The real-time ability of the lane change maneuver algorithm to generate safe and smooth trajectories is shown by experimental results of a Volvo V60 performing automated lane change maneuvers on a test track.},

For the latter, interaction between traffic participants is crucial. Consequently, simulations where other traffic participants follow simple behavioral rules can no longer beused for development and evaluation. To close this gap, we present a multi vehicle simulation framework. Conventional simulation agents, using a simple, rule-based behavior, are replaced by multiple instances of sophisticated behavior generation algorithms. Thus, development, test and simulative evaluation of cooperative planning approaches is facilitated.

It requires to solve a two-point boundary value problem that connects a start and a goal configuration with a collision-free trajectory. This paper introduces a novel approach for motion planning under uncertainty resulting in motion plans with higher robustness due to a bounded risk of collision. To that end, the state of the art G1and G2 continuous steering functions, namely Dubins, Reeds-Shepp, Hybrid Curvature, and Continuous Curvature Steer, are extended to belief space, where an expected vehicle state is augmented by its associated uncertainty. The so-called beliefs are obtained by propagating a Gaussian probability distribution along the nominal path of the steering function while taking into account the control and localization uncertainty. A novel concept for collision avoidance in Gaussian belief space is then introduced that considers the shape of the vehicle and the full information about the uncertainty of a state. Together with the sampling-based motion planner RRT*, the proposed realtime capable methodology reduces the collision probability by an order of magnitude in three challenging automated driving scenarios.},

In cases of high traffic density this becomes more complex since one must consider the interaction with other vehicles. We formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) by including the surrounding drivers in the state space to realize interactive behavior. The problem is solved online by an anytime Monte Carlo sampling algorithm in combination with an efficient A* rollout heuristic. This combination makes a combined lateral and longitudinal optimization possible. The resulting policy is optimized regarding various future merge scenarios and approaches the most suitable gap while taking into account the uncertain behavior of the surrounding drivers. Therefore, we present a novel motion model representing the uncertain cooperation of other drivers. It is based on a logistic regression model estimating the probability for cooperative behavior of a human driver given a future scene. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by various simulated scenarios. The resulting behavior for approaching gaps, estimating the future cooperative behavior of surrounding drivers and performing merges in narrow gaps are discussed.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel method termed Frustum ConvNet (F-ConvNet) for amodal 3D object detection from point clouds. Given 2D region proposals in a RGB image, our method first generates a sequence of frustums for each region proposal, and uses the obtained frustums to group local points. F-ConvNet aggregates point-wise features as frustumlevel feature vectors, and arrays these feature vectors as a feature map for use of its subsequent component of fully convolutional network (FCN), which spatially fuses frustumlevel features and supports an end-to-end and continuous estimation of oriented boxes in the 3D space. We also propose component variants of L-ConvNet, including a FCN variant that extracts multi-resolution frustum features, and a refined use of L-ConvNet over a reduced 3D space. Careful ablation studies verify the efficacy of these component variants. LConvNet assumes no prior knowledge of the working 3D environment, and is thus dataset-agnostic. We present experiments on both the indoor SUN-RGBD and outdoor KITTI datasets. LConvNet outperforms all existing methods on SUN-RGBD, and at the time of submission it outperforms all published works on the KITTI benchmark. We will make the code of L-ConvNet publicly available.},

Its popularity is grounded in its simplicity and its capacity to describe both single vehicle velocity profiles as well as collective traffic behavior. Nevertheless, it lacks a series of properties that would be desirable for more realistic agent models. In this paper, as an alternative and improvement to the IDM, we propose the Foresighted Driver Model (FDM), which assumes that a driver acts in a way that balances predictive risk (e.g. due to possible collisions along its route) with utility (e.g. the time required to travel, smoothness of ride, etc.). Based on a risk concept developed for full behavior planning, we introduce driver model equations from the assumption that a driver will mainly try to avoid risk maxima in time and space. We show how such a model can be used to simulate driving behavior similar to full behavior planning models and which generalizes and reaches beyond the IDM modeling scenarios.},

Our new approach plans fail-safe trajectories in arbitrary traffic scenarios by incorporating convex optimization techniques. By integrating safety verification in the planner, we are able to generate fail-safe trajectories in real-time, which are guaranteed to be safe. At the same time, we minimize jerk to provide enhanced comfort for passengers.

The network is composed of two subnetworks: one for 3D object proposal generation and another for multi-view feature fusion. The proposal network generates 3D candidate boxes efficiently from the birds eye view representation of 3D point cloud. We design a deep fusion scheme to combine region-wise features from multiple views and enable interactions between intermediate layers of different paths. Experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by around 25\% and 30\% AP on the tasks of 3D localization and 3D detection.

The optimization problem is solved by means of a linear time-varying model predictive control scheme that generates trajectories for path following under consideration of various time-varying system constraints in a receding horizon fashion. Formulating the system dynamics linearly in combination with a quadratic cost function has two great advantages. First, the system constraints can be set up not only to achieve collision avoidance with both static and dynamic obstacles, but also aspects of human driving behavior can be considered. Second, the optimization problem can be solved very efficiently, such that the algorithm can be run with little computational effort. In addition, due to an elaborate problem formulation, reference curves with discontinuous, high curvatures will be effortlessly smoothed out by the algorithm. This makes the proposed algorithm applicable to different traffic scenarios, such as parking or highway driving. Experimental results are presented for different real-world scenarios to demonstrate the algorithm's abilities.},

As it is overwhelming to program the action rules case-by-case, a unified planning framework under uncertainty is proposed in this paper, which achieves a non-conservatively defensive strategy (NCDS) in various kinds of scenarios for urban autonomous driving. First, uncertainties in urban scenarios are simplified to two probabilistic cases, namely passing and yielding. Two-way-stop intersection is used as an exemplar scenario to illustrate the derivation of probabilities for different intentions of others via a logistic regression model. Then a deterministic planner is designed as the baseline. Also, a safe set is defined, which considers both current and preview safety. The planning framework under uncertainty is then proposed, in which safety is guaranteed and overcautious behavior is prevented. Finally, the proposed planning framework is tested by simulation in the exemplar scenario, which demonstrates that an NCDS can be realistically achieved by employing the proposed framework.},

The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traffic upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traffic. The experimental findings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traffic near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a continuous microscopic single-lane model, the “intelligent driver model,” using empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has essentially the same effect as an on-ramp.},

  abstract = {With the objective to improve road safety, the automotive industry is moving toward more “intelligent” vehicles. One of the major challenges is to detect dangerous situations and react accordingly in order to avoid or mitigate accidents. This requires predicting the likely evolution of the current traffic situation, and assessing how dangerous that future situation might be. This paper is a survey of existing methods for motion prediction and risk assessment for intelligent vehicles. The proposed classification is based on the semantics used to define motion and risk. We point out the tradeoff between model completeness and real-time constraints, and the fact that the choice of a risk assessment method is influenced by the selected motion model.},

  abstract = {We present one approach to achieve safe navigation in an indoor dynamic environment. So far, there have been various useful collision avoidance algorithms and path planning schemes. However, those algorithms possess fundamental limitations in that the robot can avoid only ldquovisiblerdquo ones among surrounded obstacles. In a real environment, it is not possible to detect all the dynamic obstacles around the robot. There are many occluded regions due to the limited field of view. In order to avoid collisions, it is desirable to exploit visibility information. This paper proposes a safe navigation scheme to reduce collision risk considering occluded dynamic obstacles. The robot's motion is controlled by the hybrid control scheme. The possibility of collision is dually reflected to path planning and speed control. The proposed scheme clearly indicates the structural procedure on how to model and to exploit the risk of navigation. The proposed scheme is experimentally tested in a real office building. The experimental results show that the robot moves along the safe path to obtain sufficient field of view. In addition, safe speed constraints are applied in motion control. It is experimentally verified that a robot safely navigates in dynamic indoor environment by adopting the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a generic approach for tactical decision-making under uncertainty in the context of driving. The complexity of this task mainly stems from the fact that rational decision-making in this context must consider several sources of uncertainty: The temporal evolution of situations cannot be predicted without uncertainty because other road users behave stochastically and their goals and plans cannot be measured. Even more important, road users are only able to perceive a tiny part of the current situation with their sensors because measurements are noisy and most of the environment is occluded. In order to anticipate the consequences of decisions a probabilistic approach, considering both forms of uncertainty, is necessary. We address this by formulating the task of driving as a continuous Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that can be automatically optimized for different scenarios. As driving is a continuous-space problem, the belief space is infinite-dimensional. We do not use a symbolic representation or discretize the state space a priori because there is no representation of the state space that is optimal for every situation. Instead, we employ a continuous POMDP solver that learns a good representation of the specific situation.},

The assessment of collision risk against moving vehicles in the occluded area is difficult because vehicle motion information for perception is not available. In order to overcome this difficulty, this paper presents a probabilistic approach of collision risk assessment for the potential collision of vehicles in the occluded area. The probabilistic assessment consists of three steps: a field of view (FoV) modeling of perception, a motion prediction of potential collision, and a probabilistic collision risk assessment. The first step is a FoV modeling of perception to classify the occluded region of perception visibility. The second step is motion predictions of the potential collision vehicles by applying the modeled FoV to the roadway geometry in the precise map. The final step is a probabilistic assessment of the collision risk for the occluded vehicles based on the motion predictions and probabilistic modeling of vehicle speed on the road. The proposed collision risk assessment was evaluated using various occlusion scenarios in real traffic situations, such as an alleyway.},

This requires using non-deterministic models for prediction. While stochastic models are useful for long-term planning, we use set-valued non-determinism capturing all possible behaviors in order to verify the safety of planned maneuvers. To reduce the set of solutions, our earlier work considers traffic rules; however, it neglects mutual influences between traffic participants. This work presents the first solution for establishing interaction within set-based prediction of traffic participants. Instead of explicitly modeling dependencies between vehicles, we trim reachable occupancy regions to consider interaction, which is computationally much more efficient.

In such a situation, the upper-bounded planning time prevents from computing a complete motion to the goal, partial motion planning is in order. Besides the presence of moving obstacles whose future behaviour is unknown precludes absolute motion safety (in the sense that no collision will ever take place whatever happens) is impossible to guarantee. The stance taken herein is to settle for a weaker level of motion safety called passive motion safety: it guarantees that, if a collision takes place, the robot will be at rest. The primary contribution of this paper is PassPMP, a partial motion planner enforcing passive motion safety. PassPMP periodically computes a passively safe partial trajectory designed to drive the robot towards its goal state. Passive motion safety is handled using a variant of the Inevitable Collision State (ICS) concept called Braking ICS, i.e. states such that, whatever the future braking trajectory of the robot, a collision occurs before it is at rest. Simulation results demonstrate how PassPMP operates and handles limited sensory field-of-views, occlusions and moving obstacles with unknown future behaviour. More importantly, PassPMP is provably passively safe.},

Thus, only key aspects are typically described in scientific publications, making it impossible to reproduce results - yet, re-producibility is an important asset of good science. Composable benchmarks for motion planning on roads (CommonRoad) are proposed so that numerical experiments are fully defined by a unique ID; all information required to reconstruct the experiment can be found on the CommonRoad website. Each benchmark is composed by a vehicle model, a cost function, and a scenario (including goals and constraints). The scenarios are partly recorded from real traffic and partly hand-crafted to create dangerous situations. We hope that CommonRoad saves researchers time since one does not have to search for realistic parameters of vehicle dynamics or realistic traffic situations, yet provides the freedom to compose a benchmark that fits one's needs.},

This paper tackles the scenario of a left turn maneuver in an urban environment with the presence of blind corners. We consider pedestrians and vehicles possibly hidden by parking cars, buildings or vegetation. In these cases, our approach allows to safely merge into traffic by using an environment representation based on tracked objects as well as an object-free sensor fusion including the calculation of unobservable regions in a digital map. A free-to-drive section of our desired path is obtained by long-term propagation of observed or possibly unobservable movement. The presented approach allows advancing into the road in a cautious manner, successively increasing the observable area.},

In recurring situations, this may lead to an imbalanced distribution of the benefit. However, humans prefer balanced utility distributions over imbalanced ones. While state-of-the-art cooperative decentralized decision making may promote such an imbalanced utility distribution, advanced cooperative decentralized decision making can support equality among the agents. Three different approaches are compared: Considering the agents' utilities perfect substitutes, imperfect substitutes, and perfect substitutes with time-variable rates of substitution based on a cooperative reward system. Simulations of a highway scenario reveal the differences in recurring situations: Perfect substitutes indeed maximize total utility, but at the expense of a highly unequal utility distribution that may lead to poor long-term user acceptance; imperfect substitutes promote an equal utility distribution, but leave much of the potential of cooperative behavior unused; introducing a cooperative reward system based on memories of costs is shown to allow for a trade-off between both - altruistic-cooperative behavior without constant preference of one agent over the other, which is assumed to improve user acceptance.},

When multiple autonomous agents share the same area, conflict situations may occur that need to be solved. We present a decentralized decision making algorithm to solve conflicts among autonomous agents. It is based on two main ideas: First, we introduce an innovative operationalization of cooperative behavior which allows to determine whether a behavior is cooperative by computing the total utility and comparing it to a reference utility. Second, we use motion primitives as a representation of available maneuvers obeying individual and environmental restrictions. The decentralized decision making algorithm is based on communication among the autonomous agents to find an optimal maneuver combination. Simulations show that our algorithm is applicable to different highway traffic scenarios of two automated vehicles. We use a mean-square acceleration as an individual cost function and show that our intelligent controller leads to cooperative solutions.},

Cooperation among the actors in an intelligent transport system (ITS) can introduce several benefits, for instance, increase safety, comfort, efficiency. Automation has also evolved in vehicle control and active safety functions. Combining cooperation and automation would enable more advanced functions such as automated highway merge and negotiating right-of-way in a cooperative intersection. However, the combination have influences on the structure of the overall transport systems as well as on its behaviour. In order to provide a common understanding of such systems, this paper presents an analysis of cooperative ITS (C-ITS) with regard to dimensions of cooperation.

  abstract = {This contribution provides a review of fundamental goals, development and future perspectives of driver assistance systems. Mobility is a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs. Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization. A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal and market trends. The paper closes with a view on current research fields.},

In recent years the way to represent a task plan to control an autonomous agent has been shifting from the standard FSM towards BTs. Many works in the literature have highlighted and proven the benefits of such design compared to standard approaches, especially in terms of modularity, reactivity and human readability. However, these works have often failed in providing a tangible comparison in the implementation of those policies and the programming effort required to modify them. This is a relevant aspect in many robotic applications, where the design choice is dictated both by the robustness of the policy and by the time required to program it. In this work, we compare backward chained BTs with a fault-tolerant design of FSMs by evaluating the cost to modify them. We validate the analysis with a set of experiments in a simulation environment where a mobile manipulator solves an item fetching task.},

While interfaces on the perception side, like object lists, point clouds or occupancy grids, are to a certain degree settled already, they are quite vague in the consecutive steps of context modeling and in particular on the side of driving execution. The authors consider the scene as the central interface between perception and behavior planning \& control. Within the behavior planning \& control block, a situation is a central data container. A scenario is a common approach to substantiate test cases for functional modules and can be used to detail the functional description of a system. However, definitions of these terms are often-at best-vague or even contradictory. This paper will review these definitions and come up with a consistent definition for each term. Moreover, we present an example for the implementation of each of these interfaces.},

  abstract = {Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) already make a major contribution to driving safety. To further increase this contribution, it is, however, vital that future intelligent vehicles perceive, predict, and assess their environment more comprehensively. In this context, the present dissertation approaches the questions i) how to represent the driving environment adequately within an environment model, ii) how to obtain such a representation, and iii) how to predict the future traffic scene evolution for proper criticality assessment. Bayesian inference provides the common theoretical framework of all designed methods. Based on the shortcomings of existing environment representations, a novel parametric representation of general driving environments is first introduced in this work. It consists of a combination of dynamic object maps for moving objects and so-called Parametric Free Space (PFS) maps for static environment structures. PFS maps model the environment by a closed curve around the vehicle, which encloses relevant drivable free space. The representation compactly describes all essential information contained in common occupancy grid maps, suppresses irrelevant details, and consistently separates between static and dynamic environment objects. A novel method for grid mapping in dynamic road environments provides the basis to realize this representation. Therein, dynamic cell hypothesis are detected, clustered, and subsequently tracked and classified with an adaptive Bayesian multiple model filter for jump Markov nonlinear systems – the so-called Interacting Multiple Model Unscented Kalman Probabilistic Data Association Filter (IMM-UK-PDAF). The intermediate result is a dynamic object map and an optimized grid of the static driving environment. From the optimized grid, relevant free space is then extracted by methods of image analysis, and robustly converted to a PFS map in a final B-Spline contour tracking step. Evaluations and experiments, which were performed with an experimental vehicle equipped with radars and a stereo camera in real driving environments, confirm the advantages of the real-time capable approach. The so-obtained representation additionally forms the basis of a novel method for long-term trajectory prediction and criticality assessment. Therein, a three-layered Bayesian network is used to infer current driving maneuvers of traffic participants initially. A trash maneuver class allows the detection of irrational driving behavior and the seamless application from highly-structured to non-structured environments. Subsequently, maneuver-based prediction models in form of stochastic processes are presented and employed to predict the vehicle configurations under consideration of uncertainties in the maneuver executions. Finally, the criticality time metric Time-To-Critical-Collision-Probability (TTCCP) is introduced as a generalization of the time metric Time-To-Collision (TTC) for arbitrary, uncertain, multi-object driving environments and longer prediction horizons. The TTCCP considers all uncertain, maneuver-based predictions and is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations confirm its potential to suppress false warnings, to generate timely true warnings, and to generate warnings in critical almost-collision situations effectively. All methods are part of the driver assistance system PRORETA 3, which has been co-developed in the context of this thesis. It constitutes a novel, integrated approach to collision avoidance and vehicle automation and thereby makes a valuable contribution to realize the Vision Zero – the vision of a future without traffic deaths.},

  abstract = {This paper tackles the collision-avoidance problem in air traffic management. The problem consists of deciding the best strategy for new aircraft configurations (velocity and altitude changes) such that all conflicts in the airspace, i.e., the loss of the minimum safety distance that has to be kept between two aircraft, are avoided. A mixed 0-1 linear optimization model based on geometric transformations for collision avoidance between an arbitrary number of aircraft in the airspace is developed. Knowing the initial coordinates, angle direction, and level flight, the new configuration for each aircraft is established by minimizing several objective functions, e.g., velocity variation and total number of changes (velocity and altitude), and forcing to return to the original flight configuration when no aircraft are in conflict. Due to the small computational time for the execution, the new configuration approach can be used in real time by using optimization software.},

  abstract = {The development of the autonomous vehicle named “Caroline” for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge was a great opportunity to demonstrate the abilities of the Technische Universität Braunschweig in the research field of autonomous driving. Among 11 teams out of the initially 89, the CarOLO team mastered the challenges to qualify for the final DARPA Urban Challenge event. Based on this experience, the Technische Universität Braunschweig is currently working on the follow-up project “Stadtpilot” with the objective to drive fully autonomously on Braunschweig's entire ring road, which is known as the arterial road of its inner city traffic. This paper introduces the “Stadtpilot”-Project in the context of the Urban Challenge experience and identifies the differences to previous activities in this research context. The scientific claim will be shown in contrast to the Urban Challenge scenario. Completely new concepts are required to master the challenges of realizing autonomous driving in the domain of Braunschweig's inner ring road. An approach for the comprehensive treatment of path-planned sections is shown that realizes complex and precise autonomous driving maneuvers in a real urban environment and is observed as the first major success of the “Stadtpilot”-Project. Curvature optimized trajectories are generated over the whole roadway that are independent from the way driving decisions are found.},

  abstract = {Fully automated driving will require intelligent systems capable of understanding, reacting to, and interacting with the intricate complexities of the real world. With the onset of autonomous driving it becomes increasingly necessary to develop advanced tools for establishing trust in intelligent safety systems that act without or despite human input. This thesis presents novel contributions to simulation-based validation, including human driver behavior and sensor models, distributions over driving scenes, and a new technique for the accelerated validation of advanced automotive active safety systems such as autonomous vehicles. Advances to human driver behavior models include the introduction of behavioral cloning models based on Bayesian networks that better capture driver behavior over short horizons. A general input architecture for deep sensor models is introduced and used to develop a stochastic model over an automotive radar's power field. Original contributions are made to the representation of distributions over driving scenes and situations, which must capture a variable number of traffic participants on arbitrary roadways. Finally, this thesis introduces a new method for accelerated validation using importance sampling over clusters of critical situations, prioritizing simulation of critical scenes and avoiding countless simulations of benign driving scenarios while backing out the correct performance statistics},

In the presented study, it is investigated how VR can be used as a tool for Usability Tests to evaluate Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for communication between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Singapore with its regulations and requirements has been selected as reference. Beyond the findings that explicit HMI concepts improve the communication between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians, VR was validated as suitable tool to conduct Usability Tests.

In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a Segway and a car. We found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a combination of modalities such as visual, auditory, and physical.},

The goal of this paper is to add to the equation two additional crucial parameters. The first is standardization of safety assurance --- what are the minimal requirements that every self-driving car must satisfy, and how can we verify these requirements. The second parameter is scalability --- engineering solutions that lead to unleashed costs will not scale to millions of cars, which will push interest in this field into a niche academic corner, and drive the entire field into a "winter of autonomous driving". In the first part of the paper we propose a white-box, interpretable, mathematical model for safety assurance, which we call Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS). In the second part we describe a design of a system that adheres to our safety assurance requirements and is scalable to millions of cars.},

Moreover, we outline the approaches of the project UNICARagil to address the validation challenge for automated vehicles.

We propose automatically deriving these two heuristics for RRT* by locally linearizing the domain dynamics and applying linear quadratic regulation (LQR). The resulting algorithm, LQR-RRT*, finds optimal plans in domains with complex or underactuated dynamics without requiring domain-specific design choices.

Their planning times, however, can scale poorly for such robots, which has motivated researchers to study hierarchical techniques that grow the RRT trees in more focused ways. Along this line, we introduce Theta*-RRT that hierarchically combines (discrete) any-angle search with (continuous) RRT motion planning for nonholonomic wheeled robots. Theta*-RRT is a variant of RRT that generates a trajectory by expanding a tree of geodesics toward sampled states whose distribution summarizes geometric information of the any-angle path. We show experimentally, for both a differential drive system and a high-dimensional truck-and-trailer system, that Theta*-RRT finds shorter trajectories significantly faster than four baseline planners (RRT, A*-RRT, RRT*, A*-RRT*) without loss of smoothness, while A*-RRT* and RRT* (and thus also Informed RRT*) fail to generate a first trajectory sufficiently fast in environments with complex nonholonomic constraints. We also prove that Theta*-RRT retains the probabilistic completeness of RRT for all small-time controllable systems that use an analytical steer function.},

The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot from an ini ial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot’s environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot’s high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstacle-based global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.},

  abstract = {A motion planning algorithm is described for bounding over rough terrain with the LittleDog robot. Unlike walking gaits, bounding is highly dynamic and cannot be planned with quasi-steady approximations. LittleDog is modeled as a planar five-link system, with a 16-dimensional state space; computing a plan over rough terrain in this high-dimensional state space that respects the kinodynamic constraints due to underactuation and motor limits is extremely challenging. Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are known for fast kinematic path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces in the presence of obstacles, but search efficiency degrades rapidly with the addition of challenging dynamics. A computationally tractable planner for bounding was developed by modifying the RRT algorithm by using: (1) motion primitives to reduce the dimensionality of the problem; (2) Reachability Guidance, which dynamically changes the sampling distribution and distance metric to address differential constraints and discontinuous motion primitive dynamics; and (3) sampling with a Voronoi bias in a lower-dimensional “task space” for bounding. Short trajectories were demonstrated to work on the robot, however open-loop bounding is inherently unstable. A feedback controller based on transverse linearization was implemented, and shown in simulation to stabilize perturbations in the presence of noise and time delays.},

Practical applications favor “anytime”  algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then,  given more computation time available during plan execution,  improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper  describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like  the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike  the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We  present two key extensions to the RRT*, committed trajectories  and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable  the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation  time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time  implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of  Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment,  and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods.

Importantly, our results do not depend strongly on local irregularities of the configuration space, as was the case with previous analysis. These results are illustrated with a simple but illuminating example. In this example, we provide estimates for N, the principal parameter of the method, in order to achieve failure probability within prescribed bounds. We also compare, through this example, the different approaches to the analysis of the planning method.},

  abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (/spl ap/150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds).},

An autonomous system only relying on predefined road priorities and considering other drivers as moving objects will cause the vehicle to freeze and fail the maneuver. Human drivers leverage the cooperation of other drivers to avoid such deadlock situations and convince others to change their behavior. Decision making algorithms must reason about the interaction with other drivers and anticipate a broad range of driver behaviors. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning approach to learn how to interact with drivers with different cooperation levels. We enhanced the performance of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms by maintaining a belief over the level of cooperation of other drivers. We show that our agent successfully learns how to navigate a dense merging scenario with less deadlocks than with online planning methods.},

This work was motivated by and experimentally validated in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where robotic vehicles had to autonomously navigate parking lots. The core of our approach to path planning consists of two phases. The first phase uses a variant of A* search (applied to the 3D kinematic state space of the vehicle) to obtain a kinematically feasible trajectory. The second phase then improves the quality of the solution via numeric non-linear optimization, leading to a local (and frequently global) optimum. Further, we extend our algorithm to use prior topological knowledge of the environment to guide path planning, leading to faster search and final trajectories better suited to the structure of the environment. We present experimental results from the DARPA Urban Challenge, where our robot demonstrated near-flawless performance in complex general path-planning tasks such as navigating parking lots and executing U-turns on blocked roads. We also present results on autonomous navigation of real parking lots. In those latter tasks, which are significantly more complex than the ones in the DARPA Urban Challenge, the time of a full replanning cycle of our planner is in the range of 50—300 ms.},

The project pushed visual localization, environment perception and automated parking to centimetre precision. The developed infrastructure-based camera calibration and semi-supervised semantic mapping concepts greatly reduce maintenance efforts. Results are presented from extensive month-long field tests.},

  abstract = {For companies in the automation industry, the development of real-time Ethernet to connect devices is of high economic interest to replace conventional fieldbus systems. Therefore, many approaches for adapting Ethernet to real-time requirements come from industrial applications. This is a challenging task as the original Ethernet standard IEEE 802.3 was not designed for real-time data transmission. Likewise, protocols basing on Ethernet like TCP, UDP, and IP do typically not consider real-time requirements. Hence, adaptations on several OSI layers become necessary to make the industrial system meet hard real-time requirements. For this purpose, a multitude of realtime capable Industrial Ethernet systems has been developed, which solve the problems of standard Ethernet- and TCP/IP- or UDP/IP-based communication in a variety of ways. This paper gives a summary of different Industrial Ethernet protocols for the real-time data transmission via Ethernet in automation environments. Advantages and disadvantages of these protocols are analyzed with regard to their sustainability in terms of their realtime capability, reliability, scalability, self-configuration of the network, and hardware requirements. Against the background of connected devices tremendously growing in number and computational power in the prospective “Industrial Internet”, consequences for future developments are drawn.},

Furthermore, DSDNet explicitly exploits the predicted future distributions of actors to plan a safe maneuver by using a structured planning cost. Our sample-based formulation allows us to overcome the difficulty in probabilistic inference of continuous random variables. Experiments on a number of large-scale self driving datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between vehicles and pedestrians, the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors, such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian-driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem, including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention. Based on our findings, we will discuss the open problems and propose future research directions.},

In this paper we present a stochastic filter which is able to select a representative set of reasonable trajectories from this solution set using additional information from a digital map. This is achieved by representing the map's traffic lanes by their corresponding centerlines. Each detected vehicle is projected on these centerlines, where the necessary information is modeled as a multivariate random variable. With this stochastic model of traffic lanes and the stochastic vector of vehicle detection we define a new stochastic residual vector, which is used both in the lane assignment and during the generation of the motion predictions. For each traffic lane, which is assigned as relevant for a detected vehicle, we generate a new motion hypothesis by using an Extended Kalman Filter. To assess the plausibility of each motion hypothesis we employ an adaptive multivariate MCUSUM algorithm. The implemented stochastic filter is tested by evaluating real data from the Ko-FAS Research Initiative. While traditional motion prediction based on previous and current motion states of a vehicle only provide plausible prediction for a short term time horizon, we show that our approach achieves a reasonable motion hypothesis for long prediction intervals especially in complex scenarios as road intersections.},

Therefore, the goal of this work is to fuse information from multiple lidars, radars, a stereo camera and semantic camera information into one common scene representation. In contrast to past publications, we focus on the combination of distance measurements and semantic estimates in the image domain in one common evidential framework. Grid maps are used as common fusion structure which enable efficient data processing. The approach is validated on an automated driving plattform in real traffic scenarios. Experiments show that the scene reconstruction precision increases while still retaining the real-time capability.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Object tracking is crucial for planning safe maneuvers of mobile robots in dynamic environments, in particular for autonomous driving with surrounding traffic participants. Multi-stage processing of sensor measurement data is thereby required to obtain abstracted high-level objects, such as vehicles. This also includes sensor fusion, data association, and temporal filtering. Often, an early-stage object abstraction is performed, which, however, is critical, as it results in information loss regarding the subsequent processing steps. We present a new grid-based object tracking approach that, in contrast, is based on already fused measurement data. The input is thereby pre-processed, without abstracting objects, by the spatial grid cell discretization of a dynamic occupancy grid, which enables a generic multi-sensor detection of moving objects. On the basis of already associated occupied cells, presented in our previous work, this paper investigates the subsequent object state estimation. The object pose and shape estimation thereby benefit from the freespace information contained in the input grid, which is evaluated to determine the current visibility of extracted object parts. An integrated object classification concept further enhances the assumed object size. For a precise dynamic motion state estimation, radar Doppler velocity measurements are integrated into the input data and processed directly on the object-level. Our approach is evaluated with real sensor data in the context of autonomous driving in challenging urban scenarios.},

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are not reliable in urban environments due to multipath and shadowing effects. Vision-based localization offers a promising alternative. We present a high-precision six degrees of freedom self-localization method using multiple cameras covering the surrounding environment. First, a point feature map is created using images from a previous pass of the area to map. Thereafter, the map is used for high-precision localization in real-time. While localization, a rough prior estimate of the current pose is used to shrink the search space for feature matching by projecting mapped landmarks into current images. Then, stored observations of the projected landmarks are matched to actual observations and the egopose is estimated by back-projection error minimization. Thereby, our map structure provides mapped landmarks efficiently towards localization with multiple cameras. In real-world experiments we show that our approach provides reliable localization results while passing the mapped area in arbitrary orientation.},

Performance Assessment units attached to subsystems quantify the reliability of their operation and return performance values. The Environment Condition Assessment, which is another important novelty of the architecture, informs augmented sensors on current sensing conditions. Utilizing environment conditions and performance values for subsequent centralized integrity checks allow algorithms to adapt to current driving conditions and thereby to increase their robustness. We demonstrate the benefit of the approach with the example of false positive object detection and tracking, where the detection of a ghost object is resolved in centralized performance assessment using a Bayesian network.},

  abstract = {This revision of SAE J3016 was undertaken in close cooperation between the SAE On-Road Automated Driving (ORAD) Committee and ISO TC204/WG14 through a Joint Working Group formed in 2018. This collaboration brought to bear the knowledge and expertise of global experts in driving automation technology and safety. Several new terms and definitions have been added and multiple corrections and clarifications have been made to address frequently misunderstood concepts and improve the utility of the document, especially for non-native English speakers. As in the previous version, it provides a taxonomy describing the full range of levels of driving automation in on-road motor vehicles and includes functional definitions for advanced levels of driving automation and related terms and definitions. This document does not provide specifications, or otherwise impose requirements on, driving automation systems (for further elaboration, see 8.1). Standardizing levels of driving automation and supporting terms serves several purposes, including: 1 Clarifying the role of the (human) driver, if any, during driving automation system engagement. 2 Answering questions of scope when it comes to developing laws, policies, regulations, and standards. 3 Providing a useful framework for driving automation specifications and technical requirements. 4 Providing clarity and stability in communications on the topic of driving automation, as well as a useful short-hand that saves considerable time and effort. This document has been developed according to the following guiding principles; namely, it should: 1 Be descriptive and informative rather than normative. 2 Provide functional definitions. 3 Be consistent with current industry practice. 4 Be consistent with prior art to the extent practicable. 5 Be useful across disciplines, including engineering, law, media, and public discourse. 6 Be clear and cogent and, as such, it should avoid or define ambiguous terms. The document reflects lessons learned from various stakeholder discussions, as well as from research projects conducted in Europe and the United States by the AdaptIVe Project and by the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP) Automated Vehicle Research (AVR) Consortium, respectively. Italicized terms used in this document are also defined herein. Bracketed text within a term name indicates optional inclusion when using the term (i.e., bracketed text may be unnecessary, given the usage context).},

Methods for systematically analyzing the requirements for safety and security mechanisms are described using examples of how they are implemented in software and hardware, and how their effectiveness can be demonstrated in terms of functional and design safety are discussed.Given today’s new E-mobility and automated driving approaches, new challenges are arising and further issues concerning “Road Vehicle Safety” and “Road Traffic Safety” have to be resolved. To address the growing complexity of vehicle functions, as well as the increasing need to accommodate interdisciplinary project teams, previous development approaches now have to be reconsidered, and system engineering approaches and proven management systems need to be supplemented or wholly redefined.The book presents a continuous system development process, starting with the basic requirements of quality management and continuing until the release of a vehicle and its components for road use. Attention is paid to the necessary definition of the respective development item, the threat-, hazard- and risk analysis, safety concepts and their relation to architecture development, while the book also addresses the aspects of product realization in mechanics, electronics and software as well as for subsequent testing, verification, integration and validation phases.In November 2011, requirements for the Functional Safety (FuSa) of road vehicles were first published in ISO 26262. The processes and methods described here are intended to show developers how vehicle systems can be implemented according to ISO 26262, so that their compliance with the relevant standards can be demonstrated as part of a safety case, including audits, reviews and assessments.},

  abstract = {Waymo's mission to reduce traffic injuries and fatalities and improve mobility for all has led us to expand deployment of automated vehicles on public roads without a human driver behind the wheel. As part of this process, Waymo is committed to providing the public with informative and relevant data regarding the demonstrated safety of Waymo's automated driving system, which we call the Waymo Driver. The data presented in this paper represents more than 6.1 million miles of automated driving in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area, including operations with a trained operator behind the steering wheel from calendar year 2019 and 65,000 miles of driverless operation without a human behind the steering wheel from 2019 and the first nine months of 2020. The paper includes every collision and minor contact experienced during these operations as well as every predicted contact identified using Waymo's counterfactual, what if, simulation of events had the vehicle's trained operator not disengaged automated driving. There were 47 contact events that occurred over this time period, consisting of 18 actual and 29 simulated contact events, none of which would be expected to result in severe or life threatening injuries. This paper presents the collision typology and severity for each actual and simulated event, along with diagrams depicting each of the most significant events. Nearly all the events involved one or more road rule violations or other errors by a human driver or road user, including all eight of the most severe events, which we define as involving actual or expected airbag deployment in any involved vehicle. When compared to national collision statistics, the Waymo Driver completely avoided certain collision modes that human driven vehicles are frequently involved in, including road departure and collisions with fixed objects.},

Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navigation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implementation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning, and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers are presented, allowing the understanding of the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years. Finally, an overview of future research direction and applications is given.},

In order to account for the practical requirements of the holistic autonomous system, we propose a semi-reactive trajectory generation method, which can be tightly integrated into the behavioral layer. The method realizes long-term objectives such as velocity keeping, merging, following, stopping, in combination with a reactive collision avoidance by means of optimal-control strategies within the Frenét-Frame of the street. The capabilities of this approach are demonstrated in the simulation of a typical high-speed highway scenario.},

  abstract = {Contemporary driver assistance systems obtain a steadily increasing grade of automation. A novel system, the emergency stop assistant, performs completely autonomous driving in emergency situations. This system takes over the vehicle's control, steers the vehicle safely to the roadside and stops, if the driver suffers a health irregularity such as a heart attack. In order to navigate through the traffic, sensors have to gain information, concerning the road and the surrounding vehicles. Subsequently, the gathered data is used to analyze and interpret the traffic situation. Depending on the current situation, driving strategies are derived, which navigate the vehicle autonomously to the roadside. The information concerning suitable areas to stop the vehicle is obtained from a digital map. This paper presents a novel method of situation interpretation based on static and dynamic state space assessment. Furthermore, the decision-making process in driving strategies using a combination of hybrid automata and decision trees will be presented.},

  abstract = {In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the art of computer programming, the conceptual tools available for the design of programs, and the prevention of programming oversights and error. The initial outstanding contribution to our understanding of this subject was made by E. W. Dijkstra, whose Notes on Structured Programming form the first and major section of this book. They clearly expound the reflections of a brilliant programmer on the methods which he has hitherto unconsciously applied; there can be no programmer of the present day who could not increase his skills by a study and conscious application of these principles. In the second monograph I have tried to describe how similar principles can be applied in the design of data structures. I have suggested that in analysing a problem and groping towards a solution, a programmer should take advantage of abstract concepts such as sets, sequences, and mappings; and judiciously postpone decisions on representation until he is constructing the more detailed code of the program. The monograph also describes a range of useful ideas for data representation, and suggests the criteria relevant for their selection. The third monograph provides a synthesis of the previous two, and expounds the close theoretical and practical connections between the design of data and the design of programs. It introduces useful additional methods for program and data structuring which may be unfamiliar to many programmers. The examples show that structured programming principles can be equally applied in "bottom-up" as in "top-down" program design. The original inspiration, insight, and all the examples were contributed by O.-J. Dahl; I have only assembled the material, and added some additional explanations where I found it difficult to understand.},

They help you manage memory and process strings more easily. They provide containers and other data structures that go well beyond what the standard library offers. They make it easy to build platform-independent network applications. Simply put, these 72 libraries greatly expand your C++ toolbox. The second edition contains more than 430 examples. All examples are as short as possible, but they are complete, so you can compile and run them as is. They show you what the Boost libraries offer and give you a head start on using the libraries in your own applications. The goal of this book is to increase your efficiency as a C++ developer and to simplify software development with C++. The Boost libraries introduced in this book will help you write less code with fewer bugs and finish projects faster. Your code will be more concise and self-explanatory and more easily adapted when requirements change. The second edition is based on the Boost libraries 1.55.0 and 1.56.0 with the latter version having been released in August 2014. The examples are based on C++11 and have been tested with Visual Studio 2013, GCC 4.8 and Clang 3.3 on various platforms. For Boost libraries that were incorporated into the C++11 standard library, differences between Boost and the standard library are highlighted. The Boost libraries are one of the most important and influential open source C++ libraries. Their source code is available under a permissive free software license. Several Boost libraries have been incorporated into the C++11 standard library. The Boost libraries are developed and supported by the Boost community - a worldwide developer community with a strong interest in pushing C++ boundaries further.},

  abstract = {Urban autonomous driving decision making is challenging due to complex road geometry and multi-agent interactions. Current decision making methods are mostly manually designing the driving policy, which might result in suboptimal solutions and is expensive to develop, generalize and maintain at scale. On the other hand, with reinforcement learning (RL), a policy can be learned and improved automatically without any manual designs. However, current RL methods generally do not work well on complex urban scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework to enable model-free deep reinforcement learning in challenging urban autonomous driving scenarios. We design a specific input representation and use visual encoding to capture the low-dimensional latent states. Several state-of-the-art model-free deep RL algorithms are implemented into our framework, with several tricks to improve their performance. We evaluate our method in a challenging roundabout task with dense surrounding vehicles in a high-definition driving simulator. The result shows that our method can solve the task well and is significantly better than the baseline.},

A context representation based on probably-free gaps is proposed as a means to provide, in occluded scenes, richer information to the motion planner compared to representations only based on observed objects. Our solution builds upon the path-velocity decomposition approach. Path planning is performed with state-of-the-art techniques, while a novel trajectory abstraction is used to reason about speed profiles without explicitly generating sequences of accelerations. To efficiently identify the best safe speed profile for every path candidate, a reachability-based analysis is also formulated. The proposed planning workflow is evaluated in roundabout scenarios. Our simulation study shows that the proposed context representation facilitates the decision-making in occluded scenes and that the reachability-based planning strategy is robust, computationally efficient, and outperforms a simpler reactive strategy.},

This work proposes a behavior planner, based on a POMDP formulation, that explicitly considers possibly occluded vehicles. The future field of view of the autonomous car is predicted over the whole planning horizon. Both, occlusions which are generated by static as well as generated by dynamic objects are hereby considered. We use Monte Carlo sampling to generate possible future episodes that are used to derive an optimized policy. The sampled episodes consider the uncertain behavior of the known traffic participants as well as the existence probability of so-called phantom vehicles in occluded areas. By representing all possible, occluded vehicle configurations by its reachable set instead of single particles, a very efficient representation is found. Therefore, we ensure to consider all possible configurations which may drive out of the occluded area in our optimized policy. We propose a generic formulation of the POMDP problem that can be applied to various scenarios for urban driving. Its performance is demonstrated by using simulation scenarios at intersections including multiple vehicles and occlusions caused by static and dynamic objects. It is shown, that the autonomous vehicle approaches occluded areas by far less conservative than a baseline strategy which considers only the current field of view (fov). This is because various, future scenarios are already considered in the policy. In fact, we show that our planner is able to drive nearly the same trajectories as an omniscient planner would.},

We address these issues by presenting a reinforcement learning-based approach, which is combined with formal safety verification to ensure that only safe actions are chosen at any time. We let a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent learn to drive as close as possible to a desired velocity by executing reasonable lane changes on simulated highways with an arbitrary number of lanes. By making use of a minimal state representation, consisting of only 13 continuous features, and a Deep Q-Network (DQN), we are able to achieve fast learning rates.

One possible mode of deployment for this technology is a “transfer-hub” model where the operationally less complex highway driving is automated, while human drivers drive the more complex urban segment of the route. We study the possible net impacts on tractor-trailer operator-hours from this mode of deployment. Using data from the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey, we gather information on trucking shipments and the operator-hours required to fulfill those shipments. We find that up to 94\% of long haul trucking operator-hours may be impacted as the technology improves to operate in all weather conditions. If the technology is however restricted to the southern states where the majority of companies are currently testing automated trucking, we find that only 10\% of operator-hours are impacted. We conduct interviews with industry stakeholders including tractor-trailer operators on the feasibility of such a system of deployment. We find that an increase in short haul operation is unlikely to compensate for the loss in long haul operator-hours, despite public claims to this effect by the developers of the technology. Policymakers should consider the impact of different scenarios of deployment on the long haul trucking workforce.},

  abstract = {Automatisiertes Fahren verspricht die Sicherheit, den Komfort und die Effizienz des Straßenverkehrs zu verbessern und hat das Potenzial eine grundlegende Transformation der Mobilität anzustoßen. Neben der Wahrnehmung und Interpretation seines Umfelds muss ein automatisiertes Fahrzeug zuverlässig sichere und zeitlich konsistente Entscheidungen treffen – bspw. ob, wann und wie ein Fahrstreifenwechsel durchgeführt wird. Da es für viele Szenarien bereits spezialisierte Lösungsansätze zur Verhaltensplanung gibt, sollte die Verhaltensentscheidung in der Lage sein, diese sinnvoll miteinander zu kombinieren. Gleichzeitig muss sie robust gegen fehlerhafte Ausgaben oder gar Ausfälle einzelner Verhaltensoptionen sein. Schließlich sollte der Entscheidungsprozess transparent und nachvollziehbar sein, um einen effektiven Entwicklungsprozess zu ermöglichen. Daher wird in dieser Arbeit zunächst eine anwendungsunabhängige Systemarchitektur zur sicheren und robusten Verhaltensentscheidung vorgeschlagen. Diese setzt grundlegende Verhaltensoptionen in einem hierarchischen Arbitrationsgraphen zusammen und sichert dabei die Stellgrößen mittels Verifikation und diversen Rückfallebenen ab. Die jeweiligen Verhaltensbausteine übernehmen dabei die Situationsinterpretation und Verhaltensplanung, während generische Arbitratoren den Entscheidungsprozess realisieren. Anschließend wird diese Architektur auf den Kontext des automatisierten Fahrens angewandt und in Simulation evaluiert. Dabei planen die Verhaltensoptionen einzelne Fahrmanöver und geben diese als Trajektorien aus. Drei Verifikatoren prüfen diese auf Gültigkeit, Realisierbarkeit und Verkehrssicherheit. Stellt sich ein Fahrmanöver bspw. als unsicher heraus, greift die Arbitration auf Alternativoptionen und drei Rückfallebenen zurück, um weiterhin ein sicheres Verhalten zu erzeugen. Die Evaluation zeigt, dass die vorgestellte Methode auch bei hohen Ausfallraten ein sicheres und stabiles Fahrverhalten erzeugt. Die Entkopplung von Situationsinterpretation und Verhaltensentscheidung trägt außerdem zu einer transparenten und nachvollziehbaren Entscheidungsfindung bei. Dank konsequenter Modularität können vielfältige Methoden der Verhaltensplanung effizient und skalierbar miteinander kombiniert werden. Zudem ermöglicht der Bottom-Up Entwurf schnelles Prototyping und eine iterative Weiterentwicklung des Gesamtsystems.},
