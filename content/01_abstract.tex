This paper introduces an extension to the arbitration graph framework designed to enhance the safety and robustness of autonomous systems in complex, dynamic environments.
Building on the flexibility and scalability of arbitration graphs, the proposed method incorporates runtime verification and structured fallback layers.
This ensures that only verified and safe commands are executed while enabling graceful degradation in the presence of unexpected faults or bugs.
The approach is demonstrated using a Pac-Man simulation and further validated in the context of autonomous driving where it shows significant reductions in accident risk and improvements in overall system safety.
The bottom-up design of arbitration graphs allows for the incremental integration of new behavior components.
The extension presented in this work adds to this by clearly and precisely defining the conditions under which behavior components are considered safe, enabling the integration of experimental or not fully matured components without compromising the systemâ€™s safety.
