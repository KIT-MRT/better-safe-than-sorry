      At position \textit{b} (see \cref{fig:test-track}),
      the ego vehicle intends to change lanes at $t=\SI{1.9}{\second}$,
      but another vehicle is following close and fast.
      Without verification, the too optimistic \behavior{ChangeLaneLeft} behavior is chosen,
      leading to a collision at $t=\SI{5.3}{\second}$.
      Verification using occupancy predictions prevents this
      (\cref{fig:experiments-safe-occupancies,fig:experiments-safe-arbitration-graph,fig:experiments-safe-timeline}).
