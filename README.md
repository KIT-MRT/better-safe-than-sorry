# Safe Arbitrators Paper - IV 2025

2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, June 22-25, Cluj-Napoca, Romania

## Deadlines
- Paper Submission Deadline: 01.02.2025

## Template
- The latest version looks like [this](https://gitlab.mrt.kit.edu/MRT/ieee_conference_template_latex/-/jobs/artifacts/master/file/root.pdf?job=compile_pdf).
- Original was downloaded from [ITS papercept](http://its.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) on 2020-02-13.
- If you look for the `IEEEtran` template, use the [ieeetran branch](https://gitlab.mrt.kit.edu/MRT/misc/ieee_conference_template_latex/tree/ieeetran).


## Usage
- Fork (=make your own copy of) this repo before making changes
- Change the structure, add/remove packages, ...
- See the `IEEEtran_doc` folder for a very exhaustive howto PDF, a smaller howto example and the original bare tex template with many comments.


## Compiling
- Using `latexmk`
  - See http://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk (included in TeXLive and MiKTeX)
  - `latexmk -pdf` to generate the pdflatex
  - `latexmk -c` to delete the regeneratable files generated by latex and bibtex except pdf
- Using `Texmaker`
  - Options -> Configure Texmaker -> Bib(la)tex: biber %

### Using docker
- Running `docker compose run --rm latex_builder` will drop you in an interactive shell with all dependencies installed.
- Run latexmk as usual.
- The compiled pdf will be in the current directory and is also visible in the host system.

### Compile Tips
1. If compile time is exploding due to figures, you can enable the `draft` mode in `root.tex`: 
```latex
\usepackage[pdftex,draft]{graphicx} % to turn of figure rendering, see: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/51893/turning-off-and-on-images-in-figures
```


## Compiling arXiv Compliant Publications
arXiv uses a special TeX document production system (_TeX Live 2016_) which means that a document built with your operating system might not be compatible with arXiv.
In order to prevent this issue there is a Makefile available that builds the document on a `docker` image with TexLive 2016 and creates an `arxiv.zip` file that you can directly upload to arxiv.

To run the Makefile, call `make` within the `arxiv` directory.

**Known Issues**
- You need to be able to run `docker` as a non-root user.
