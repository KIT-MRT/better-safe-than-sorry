Comments to the author
======================

This paper proposes a safe and robust autonomous decision
making method, which is innovative to some extent, but I
think it has some shortcomings in theory and experiment:
1. the arbitration graphs proposed in this paper do not
have a specific mathematical model and proof of the
existence of the optimal solution, do not have sufficient
theoretical support, and are not technically rigorous
enough
2. the experimental comparison in this paper is
insufficient, lacking quantitative comparison with the
existing baseline and SOTA methods, and only through self
comparison with and without verification to prove the
effectiveness.
3. the two parts of the article feel very fragmented, and
can be directly used for model construction and
experimental verification in the automatic driving scene,
but the modeling experiment should be conducted in the game
environment first, and the significance of the first part
is not seen, and the connection of the content is not
smooth enough
