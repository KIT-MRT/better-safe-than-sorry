Comments to the author
======================

This paper give a comprehensive approach to enhancing
safety and robustness in autonomous systems through the
integration of verification and structured fallback
mechanisms within the arbitration graph framework. This
allows for the incremental addition of new behavior
components without compromising overall system safety,
explicitly defining responsibility for safety through the
verifiers. The system's practicality is further supported
by its demonstrated applicability in both simulated Pac-Man
and autonomous driving scenarios, building upon the
inherent flexibility, scalability, and transparency of
existing arbitration graphs while addressing the critical
need for improved safety in complex and dynamic
environments.

But I still have some questions about the method
instroduced in the paper:

Verifier Limitations: How can the system ensure safety in
scenarios where the assumptions made by the verifiers are
incomplete or inaccurate, potentially leading to unforeseen
unsafe behaviors?
Conservatism Trade-off: What strategies can be employed to
mitigate the potential for overly conservative behavior
introduced by the verification step, balancing safety with
efficiency and task completion?
Verifier Design Complexity: What methodologies or tools can
be developed to simplify the design and implementation of
effective and reliable verifiers, reducing the burden on
developers and ensuring comprehensive coverage?
Computational Cost: How can the computational overhead
introduced by the verification step be minimized to ensure
real-time performance, especially in resource-constrained
environments or systems with complex decision-making
processes?
Real-World Applicability: What additional real-world
testing and validation are planned or necessary to fully
demonstrate the system's effectiveness and robustness in
diverse and unpredictable scenarios, beyond the simulated
environments?
Invocation Condition Realism: How can the design of
invocation conditions be made more realistic to better
reflect real-world scenarios, ensuring the verification
process is tested under conditions that closely resemble
actual operating environments?
Simulation Fidelity Impact: To what extent does the
fidelity of the simulation environment affect the validity
of the results, and what measures can be taken to improve
simulation accuracy and ensure the transferability of
findings to real-world applications?
